				<h2>What Character is My Main?</h2>
					<p class= content_para>I have created several characters in this game, but my main character is my <em>Jedi Guardian</em>. This type of character is designated as a tank and in turn has abilities to mitigate damage. Also due to this class type my character has a high health count and very high defense ratings which also cause damage to be reduced. My Characters name is <strong>Greklot</strong> and his race is a <em>Sith</em>. Normally the Sith race is primarily assigned to the Empire side and not to the Republic. When I create a character, I try to make a back story of my own and not go by the norm. When I made this character, I wanted him to be a runaway from his home-world and from the line of empire bound Sith in his family.

                    <p> I dont really have any information to put in here yet so I though i would just add some random verb-age to look pretty. I am debating on talking about my personal experience with the game or maybe comparing it to another game that I played for several years. The other game being World of Warcraft. I started playing WOW when it came out and I also bought SWTOR when it came out. So in essence I am an avid gamer.
